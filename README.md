# ASL_Detection
The project implements a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet detection system using YOLOv5 and the OAK-1 PoE device. The system detects hand gestures corresponding to the letters of the ASL alphabet directly on edge, without requiring a cloud connection. The model was trained on a custom ASL dataset and optimized for real-time inference on the MyriadX VPU.
